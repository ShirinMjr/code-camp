//This is a practice JavaScript code
/* *
 * var keyword can be easily overwritten,
 * Unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.
 * It is common for developers to use uppercase variable 
 * identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays).
