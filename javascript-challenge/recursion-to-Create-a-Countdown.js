/**
 * function that returns an array of consecutive integers
 * starting with 1 through the number passed to the function.
 * There will be a base case. The base case tells the recursive function when it no longer needs to call
 * itself. It is a simple case where the return value is already known.
 * There will also be a recursive call which executes the original function with different arguments.
 * If the function is written correctly, eventually the base case will be reached.
 * 
 * We have defined a function called countdown with one parameter (n).
 * The function should use recursion to return an array containing the integers n through 1 
 * based on the n parameter.
 * If the function is called with a number less than 1, t
 * he function should return an empty array.
 * For example, calling this function with n = 5 
 * should return the array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. 
 * Your function must use recursion by calling itself and must not use loops of any kind.
